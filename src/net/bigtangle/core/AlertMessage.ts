/**
 * Alerts are signed messages that are broadcast on the peer-to-peer network if they match a hard-coded signing key.
 * The private keys are held by a small group of core Bitcoin developers, and alerts may be broadcast in the event of
 * an available upgrade or a serious network problem. Alerts have an expiration time, data that specifies what
 * set of software versions it matches and the ability to cancel them by broadcasting another type of alert.
 * 
 * The right course of action on receiving an alert is usually to either ensure a human will see it (display on screen,
 * log, email), or if you decide to use alerts for notifications that are specific to your app in some way, to parse it.
 * For example, you could treat it as an upgrade notification specific to your app. Satoshi designed alerts to ensure
 * that software upgrades could be distributed independently of a hard-coded website, in order to allow everything to
 * be purely peer-to-peer. You don't have to use this of course, and indeed it often makes more sense not to.
 * 
 * Before doing anything with an alert, you should check {@link AlertMessage#isSignatureValid}.
 * 
 * Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple threads.
