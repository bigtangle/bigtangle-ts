/**
 * <p>A DeterministicHierarchy calculates and keeps a whole tree (hierarchy) of keys originating from a single
 * root key. This implements part of the BIP 32 specification. A deterministic key tree is useful because
 * Bitcoin's privacy system require new keys to be created for each transaction, but managing all these
 * keys quickly becomes unwieldy. In particular it becomes hard to back up and distribute them. By having
 * a way to derive random-looking but deterministic keys we can make wallet backup simpler and gain the
 * ability to hand out {@link DeterministicKey}s to other people who can then create new addresses
 * on the fly, without having to contact us.</p>
 *
 * <p>The hierarchy is started from a single root key, and a location in the tree is given by a path which
 * is a list of {@link ChildNumber}s.</p>
